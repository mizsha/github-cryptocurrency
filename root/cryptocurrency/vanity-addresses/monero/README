UNOFFICIAL README UPDATE:
run ./monero-vanity REGEX
or ./monero-vanitygen --help

---------------------------------------

Install it with this:
	$ go get github.com/ehmry/monero-vanity

Run the test against simplewallet with 'make test'
or 'expect test.exp <number of iterations>'.

When it matches an input regex it prints out an address and a
secret key in hex form. Use the -convert option to get an 
Electrum word list and then use the recovery feature of 
simplewallet to build a new wallet file.

Be sure to set a proper MAXGOPROCS in your environment to 
search with more than one processor.

Good luck!
